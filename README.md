# NoteTakingApp
## Description
This is a simple C# console app that allows users to create, edit, delete and read their notes.

Notes are written in XML files on the local computer in this location: C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\Notes.

If the Notes folder does not exist in that location, it will be created.
